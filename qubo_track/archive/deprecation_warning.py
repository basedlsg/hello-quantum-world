This file contains scientifically invalid claims and has been superseded.

PROBLEMS WITH THIS FILE:
- Claims "quantum annealing" while using classical SimulatedAnnealingSampler  
- Reports false "39% quantum advantage" (actually classical SA vs weak greedy)
- No statistical validation (single runs, no confidence intervals)
- Missing exact optimum calculation for quality assessment

✅ USE INSTEAD: corrected_classical_optimization.py
