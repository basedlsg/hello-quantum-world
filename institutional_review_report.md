## Critical Scientific Findings

### üîç Root Cause Analysis

The forensic investigation revealed that the QAOA discrepancies stem from **fundamentally different approaches to calculating MaxCut values:**

**Original Study Method:**
```
Cut values = {
    '000': 0, '001': 2, '010': 1, '011': 3,
    '100': 2, '101': 0, '110': 3, '111': 1
}
```

**Verification Method:**
```python
def calculate_cut(bitstring):
    bits = [int(b) for b in bitstring]
    cut = 0
    if bits[0] != bits[1]: cut += 1  # Edge (0,1)
    if bits[1] != bits[2]: cut += 1  # Edge (1,2)  
    if bits[0] != bits[2]: cut += 1  # Edge (0,2)
    return cut
```

**Agreement Analysis:**
- Bitstrings '000', '001', '100': Methods agree
- Bitstrings '010', '011', '101', '110', '111': Methods disagree
- **Overall agreement: 37.5%**
