# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligent Experiment Orchestration System is a comprehensive platform that transforms isolated quantum computing experiments into a coordinated, adaptive research workflow. This system will enable researchers to conduct large-scale parameter sweeps, optimize resource usage, and discover insights across multiple quantum computing domains simultaneously. The system addresses the critical gap between individual project execution and systematic, data-driven quantum research at scale.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a quantum researcher, I want to define and execute multi-dimensional parameter sweeps across different quantum experiments, so that I can systematically explore parameter spaces and discover optimal configurations without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a researcher defines a parameter sweep configuration THEN the system SHALL accept parameters including noise rates, circuit depths, backend types, and custom experiment parameters
2. WHEN a parameter sweep is initiated THEN the system SHALL generate all parameter combinations and queue them for execution
3. WHEN executing parameter combinations THEN the system SHALL distribute experiments across available compute resources efficiently
4. IF a parameter combination fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and continue with remaining combinations
5. WHEN a sweep completes THEN the system SHALL provide a comprehensive results summary with statistical analysis

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a quantum researcher, I want the system to adaptively prioritize promising parameter regions during experimentation, so that I can focus computational resources on the most scientifically interesting areas and avoid wasting time on clearly suboptimal configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initial experiment results are available THEN the system SHALL analyze performance metrics to identify promising parameter regions
2. WHEN promising regions are identified THEN the system SHALL automatically increase sampling density in those areas
3. WHEN poor-performing regions are detected THEN the system SHALL reduce or skip further sampling in those areas
4. IF early results show clear trends THEN the system SHALL provide early stopping recommendations to the researcher
5. WHEN adaptive sampling is active THEN the system SHALL maintain a minimum coverage of the full parameter space for statistical validity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a quantum researcher, I want real-time monitoring and progress tracking of long-running experiments, so that I can make informed decisions about resource allocation and experiment continuation without waiting for full completion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN experiments are running THEN the system SHALL provide a real-time dashboard showing progress, current results, and resource utilization
2. WHEN experiment metrics are updated THEN the system SHALL stream results to the monitoring interface within 30 seconds
3. WHEN resource limits are approached THEN the system SHALL alert the researcher and suggest optimization strategies
4. IF experiments are taking longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide estimated completion times and cost projections
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL immediately notify the researcher with actionable error information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quantum researcher, I want to perform cross-project comparative analysis, so that I can discover insights that span multiple quantum computing domains and identify universal patterns or optimal strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN experiments from different projects complete THEN the system SHALL automatically identify comparable metrics across projects
2. WHEN comparable metrics are identified THEN the system SHALL generate cross-project visualizations and statistical comparisons
3. WHEN noise models are shared between projects THEN the system SHALL correlate performance across different quantum algorithms
4. IF significant cross-project patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight these insights in automated reports
5. WHEN requesting cross-project analysis THEN the system SHALL provide unified datasets that normalize metrics across different experimental contexts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quantum researcher, I want intelligent AWS Braket resource management, so that I can minimize costs while maximizing experimental throughput and avoid hitting service limits or budget overruns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scheduling AWS Braket experiments THEN the system SHALL optimize for cost-effectiveness by selecting appropriate device types and timing
2. WHEN AWS service limits are approached THEN the system SHALL automatically throttle requests and redistribute load
3. WHEN cost thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL pause expensive experiments and alert the researcher
4. IF cheaper alternatives are available THEN the system SHALL suggest simulator-based validation before hardware execution
5. WHEN experiments complete THEN the system SHALL provide detailed cost breakdowns and efficiency metrics

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quantum researcher, I want automated statistical analysis and report generation, so that I can quickly understand experimental results and generate publication-ready materials without manual data processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN experiment data is collected THEN the system SHALL automatically perform appropriate statistical tests for significance
2. WHEN statistical analysis completes THEN the system SHALL generate publication-quality visualizations with error bars and confidence intervals
3. WHEN multiple experiments are compared THEN the system SHALL apply multiple comparison corrections and report effect sizes
4. IF interesting patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically generate narrative summaries of key findings
5. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include methodology sections with full reproducibility information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quantum researcher, I want seamless integration with existing project structures, so that I can enhance my current workflow without disrupting established research practices or requiring major code refactoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with existing projects THEN the system SHALL work with current project structures without requiring code changes
2. WHEN experiments are orchestrated THEN the system SHALL preserve existing logging, testing, and result storage patterns
3. WHEN new orchestration features are used THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing CI/CD pipelines
4. IF project dependencies conflict THEN the system SHALL manage isolated environments automatically
5. WHEN orchestration is disabled THEN the system SHALL allow projects to run independently as before

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a quantum researcher, I want experiment reproducibility and version control, so that I can track experimental configurations, reproduce important results, and maintain scientific rigor across long-term research projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN experiments are executed THEN the system SHALL automatically record complete environment snapshots including code versions and dependencies
2. WHEN experiment configurations are saved THEN the system SHALL generate unique identifiers that enable exact reproduction
3. WHEN reproducing experiments THEN the system SHALL recreate identical environments and parameter settings
4. IF code changes affect experiment outcomes THEN the system SHALL detect and flag potential reproducibility issues
5. WHEN sharing results THEN the system SHALL package complete reproducibility information with data and visualizations
