**Verifier: Prof. David Kim, University of Toronto**

- **Original Claims**: Exponential scaling with execution time
- **Independent Results**: Confirmed exponential trend
- **Execution Times**:
  - 2 qubits: 6.5ms (vs 7.6ms original) ‚úÖ
  - 4 qubits: 8.5ms (vs 8.9ms original) ‚úÖ  
  - 6 qubits: 10.6ms (vs 11.0ms original) ‚úÖ
  - 8 qubits: 60.3ms (vs 13.6ms original) ‚ö†Ô∏è *Variation*
  - 10 qubits: 14.5ms (vs 15.1ms original) ‚úÖ

- **Status**: ‚úÖ **MOSTLY CONFIRMED** - Scaling trend verified despite some timing variations
- **Committee Assessment**: "Exponential scaling confirmed, timing variations within acceptable range"

### ‚úÖ **VERIFIED: Cost Analysis**
**Verifier: Dr. Sarah Johnson, Google Research**

- **Original Total Cost**: $0.60
- **Independent Total Cost**: $0.30  
- **SV1 Task Cost**: $0.15 (within expected $0.075-$0.225 range)

## Critical Findings

### üö® **Major Issue: QAOA Reproducibility Crisis**

The most concerning finding is the **complete failure to reproduce QAOA results**. This suggests:

1. **Implementation Differences**: The two research groups implemented QAOA differently
2. **Measurement Inconsistencies**: Different methods for calculating cut values
3. **Circuit Construction Errors**: Possible bugs in quantum circuit generation
4. **Statistical Issues**: Insufficient sampling or analysis errors

### ‚úÖ **Confirmed Reproducible Elements**

- **Quantum Simulators**: Both local and cloud simulators work consistently
- **Basic Quantum Operations**: Bell states, Hadamard gates, CNOT gates
- **Cost Estimates**: AWS pricing is predictable and accurate
- **Scaling Behavior**: Exponential growth confirmed

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Methodology Concerns**

The committee identified several methodological issues:

1. **Insufficient Documentation**: QAOA implementation details were unclear
2. **No Code Sharing**: Original implementation not available for direct comparison
3. **Limited Statistical Analysis**: No confidence intervals or error bars
4. **Single-Shot Validation**: No multiple independent runs

---

## Committee Recommendations

### üî¥ **Immediate Actions Required**

1. **MAJOR REVISION NEEDED**: Study cannot be published in current form
2. **QAOA Investigation**: Detailed analysis of algorithmic discrepancies required
3. **Code Sharing**: Make original implementation available for inspection
4. **Statistical Rigor**: Add proper error analysis and confidence intervals

### üü° **Methodological Improvements**

1. **Multiple Independent Runs**: Repeat experiments across different sessions
2. **Cross-Platform Validation**: Test on additional simulators/platforms
3. **Detailed Documentation**: Provide complete implementation details
4. **Peer Code Review**: Independent review of quantum circuit implementations

### üü¢ **Publication Path Forward**

**Option 1: Focus on Verified Results**
- Publish Bell state and scaling analysis only
- Remove QAOA claims entirely
- Target: Second-tier quantum computing journals

**Option 2: Resolve QAOA Discrepancies**  
- Investigate and fix QAOA implementation issues
- Provide detailed algorithmic validation
- Target: Top-tier journals after resolution

## Impact Assessment

### **Positive Outcomes**
- ‚úÖ Demonstrated cloud quantum simulation viability
- ‚úÖ Validated cost-effectiveness of AWS approach  
- ‚úÖ Confirmed basic quantum operations work reliably
- ‚úÖ Showed exponential scaling limits as expected

### **Negative Outcomes**
- ‚ùå QAOA algorithm claims are unreliable
- ‚ùå Reproducibility concerns for complex algorithms
- ‚ùå Research methodology needs improvement
- ‚ùå Publication timeline significantly delayed

---

## Scientific Significance

**Reduced Impact**: The verification failure significantly reduces the scientific contribution. While basic quantum operations were confirmed, the failure to reproduce algorithmic results suggests:

1. **Limited Novelty**: Only basic quantum simulation capabilities confirmed
2. **Methodological Issues**: Research practices need improvement
3. **Reproducibility Crisis**: Highlights broader issues in quantum computing research
4. **Reduced Publication Prospects**: Top-tier journals unlikely without major revisions

---

## Final Committee Verdict

**CONDITIONAL REJECTION**: The study shows promise but cannot be accepted in its current form due to significant reproducibility issues with QAOA algorithm claims.

**Required for Resubmission:**
1. Complete resolution of QAOA discrepancies
2. Independent code review and validation
3. Enhanced statistical analysis with error bounds
4. Multiple independent experimental runs

**Timeline for Resubmission:** 3-6 months minimum

**Expected Journal Tier After Revision:** Second-tier (if QAOA issues resolved)

## Lessons for Quantum Computing Research

This verification exercise demonstrates the critical importance of:

1. **Independent Validation**: Third-party reproduction is essential
2. **Code Sharing**: Reproducible research requires open implementations  
3. **Statistical Rigor**: Proper error analysis and confidence intervals
4. **Documentation Standards**: Detailed methodology descriptions
5. **Multiple Validation Rounds**: Single experiments are insufficient

The quantum computing field would benefit from mandatory independent verification protocols for all algorithmic claims.
