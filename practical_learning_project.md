# Practical Quantum Learning Project: Spatial vs Non-Spatial Effects

## Reality Check: What We Actually Have
- **AWS Braket Free Tier**: Limited simulator time, ~$300 credit
- **Local Simulator**: Unlimited for small circuits (≤10 qubits)
- **Hardware Access**: Very limited and expensive
- **Goal**: Learn by building and experimenting, not publishing papers
- **Timeline**: 2-4 weeks of evening/weekend work

## Revised Learning-Focused Project

### Phase 1: Build Understanding (Week 1)
*"Get hands dirty with quantum circuits"*

#### What We'll Actually Build
1. **Simple spatial circuit**: 4 qubits with nearest-neighbor connections
2. **Simple non-spatial circuit**: 4 qubits with all-to-all connections  
3. **Noise comparison**: See how each responds to errors
4. **Visualization tools**: Plot and understand the results

#### Learning Objectives
- Understand how quantum circuits actually work
- See the difference between local vs global interactions
- Learn to measure and interpret quantum states
- Get comfortable with AWS Braket interface

### Phase 2: Systematic Comparison (Week 2)
*"Compare spatial vs non-spatial behavior"*

#### Experiments We Can Actually Do
1. **Coherence decay**: Watch how quantum states degrade over time
2. **Noise sensitivity**: Add controlled errors and measure impact
3. **Scaling behavior**: Test 2, 3, 4, 5 qubit systems
4. **Pattern recognition**: Look for consistent differences

#### Constraints We'll Work Within
- **Budget**: <$50 total AWS costs
- **Time**: 2-3 hours per experiment
- **Complexity**: Keep circuits simple and interpretable
- **Scope**: Focus on learning, not breakthrough research

### Phase 3: Build Something Useful (Week 3-4)
*"Create tools for future learning"*

#### Practical Deliverables
1. **Quantum circuit library**: Reusable spatial/non-spatial circuits
2. **Measurement toolkit**: Functions to analyze quantum states
3. **Visualization dashboard**: See quantum behavior in real-time
4. **Learning notebook**: Document insights and patterns

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Foundation Building

#### Day 1-2: Basic Circuit Construction
```python
# Goal: Build and run first quantum circuits
def create_spatial_chain(n_qubits):
    """4-qubit chain with nearest-neighbor gates"""
    circuit = Circuit()
    # Initialize superposition
    for i in range(n_qubits):
        circuit.h(i)
    # Local connections only
    for i in range(n_qubits-1):
        circuit.cnot(i, i+1)
    return circuit

def create_nonspatial_mesh(n_qubits):
    """4-qubit mesh with all-to-all gates"""
    circuit = Circuit()
    # Initialize superposition  
    for i in range(n_qubits):
        circuit.h(i)
    # Connect everything to everything
    for i in range(n_qubits):
        for j in range(i+1, n_qubits):
            circuit.cnot(i, j)
    return circuit
```

**Learning Focus**: How do quantum gates actually work? What do these circuits do?

#### Day 3-4: Measurement and Analysis
```python
# Goal: Learn to measure quantum states
def measure_state_fidelity(circuit, noise_prob=0.0):
    """Compare ideal vs noisy quantum states"""
    # Run ideal circuit
    ideal_result = device.run(circuit, shots=1000).result()
    
    # Add noise and run again
    noisy_circuit = add_noise(circuit, noise_prob)
    noisy_result = device.run(noisy_circuit, shots=1000).result()
    
    # Calculate how different they are
    return calculate_overlap(ideal_result, noisy_result)
```

**Learning Focus**: How do we know if a quantum state is "good"? What does noise do?

#### Day 5-7: First Experiments
- Run spatial vs non-spatial circuits
- Add different amounts of noise
- Plot results and look for patterns
- **Budget**: ~$10 (mostly local simulator)

### Week 2: Systematic Investigation

#### Experiment 1: Noise Sensitivity
```python
# Test how each circuit type responds to errors
noise_levels = [0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1]
spatial_fidelities = []
nonspatial_fidelities = []

for noise in noise_levels:
    spatial_fid = measure_state_fidelity(spatial_circuit, noise)
    nonspatial_fid = measure_state_fidelity(nonspatial_circuit, noise)
    
    spatial_fidelities.append(spatial_fid)
    nonspatial_fidelities.append(nonspatial_fid)

# Plot and analyze
plt.plot(noise_levels, spatial_fidelities, label='Spatial')
plt.plot(noise_levels, nonspatial_fidelities, label='Non-spatial')
plt.show()
```

**Learning Focus**: Which circuit type is more robust? Why?

#### Experiment 2: Size Scaling
```python
# See how behavior changes with system size
system_sizes = [2, 3, 4, 5]  # Keep small for budget
results = {}

for n in system_sizes:
    spatial_circuit = create_spatial_chain(n)
    nonspatial_circuit = create_nonspatial_mesh(n)
    
    # Test with fixed noise level
    spatial_fid = measure_state_fidelity(spatial_circuit, 0.05)
    nonspatial_fid = measure_state_fidelity(nonspatial_circuit, 0.05)
    
    results[n] = {'spatial': spatial_fid, 'nonspatial': nonspatial_fid}
```

**Learning Focus**: How does quantum behavior change as systems get bigger?

#### Budget Management
- **Local simulator**: Free for circuits ≤10 qubits
- **AWS SV1**: ~$0.075 per task (use sparingly)
- **Target spending**: $20-30 for Week 2

### Week 3-4: Building Tools

#### Create Reusable Library
```python
class QuantumCircuitExplorer:
    """Tool for learning about quantum circuits"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.device = LocalSimulator()
        self.results_history = []
    
    def compare_circuit_types(self, n_qubits, noise_level):
        """Compare spatial vs non-spatial circuits"""
        # Implementation here
        
    def visualize_quantum_state(self, circuit):
        """Show what the quantum state looks like"""
        # Implementation here
        
    def run_learning_experiment(self, experiment_type):
        """Guided experiments for learning"""
        # Implementation here
```
