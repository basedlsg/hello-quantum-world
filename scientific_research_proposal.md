# Comparative Study of Decoherence Mechanisms in Gate-Based vs Spatial Quantum Systems

## Abstract

We propose a comparative experimental study to quantify decoherence characteristics in entanglement-based gate systems versus spatial quantum arrays using AWS Braket quantum hardware. This 4-week study will measure coherence times, error rates, and scaling behavior across different quantum computing architectures to determine their relative performance for near-term applications.

## Background

Current quantum computing research focuses primarily on gate-based systems using quantum entanglement, with limited systematic comparison to spatial quantum approaches. Recent theoretical work suggests spatial quantum systems may exhibit different decoherence characteristics, but experimental validation on real hardware is lacking.

## Research Questions

1. How do coherence times scale with system size in gate-based vs spatial quantum systems?
2. What are the relative error rates and their scaling behavior for each approach?
3. Which architecture provides better performance for optimization problems of varying sizes?
4. What are the cost-effectiveness trade-offs between approaches?

## Methodology

### Hardware Platforms
- **Gate-based systems**: IonQ Aria-1 (25 qubits), Rigetti Ankaa-3 (84 qubits), IQM Garnet (20 qubits)
- **Spatial system**: QuEra Aquila (256 neutral atoms)
- **Control**: AWS Braket simulators (SV1, DM1, TN1)

### Experimental Design

**Week 1: Baseline Characterization**
- Measure 2-qubit, 3-qubit, and 4-qubit entangled state fidelities
- Characterize decoherence times using Ramsey interferometry
- Document error rates across different gate-based platforms
- Budget allocation: $100-150

**Week 2: Spatial Array Studies**
- Test coherence in 16, 64, and 256-atom configurations
- Measure spatial correlation lengths and decay times
- Characterize noise sensitivity in different array geometries
- Budget allocation: $100-150

**Week 3: Comparative Analysis**
- Run identical optimization algorithms on both architectures
- Measure time-to-solution and solution quality
- Quantify resource requirements for equivalent problem sizes
- Budget allocation: $150-200

**Week 4: Scaling Studies**
- Test maximum achievable problem sizes for each approach
- Measure performance degradation with system size
- Evaluate cost-performance metrics
- Budget allocation: $100-150

### Budget Justification

Total project cost: $569.70
- QPU usage: ~$400 (distributed across 4 platforms)
- Simulation time: ~$70 (beyond free tier allocation)
- AWS services: ~$100 (storage, monitoring, compute)

This represents standard costs for experimental quantum computing research and is comparable to single-day usage in many quantum labs.

## Expected Outcomes

### Quantitative Metrics
- Coherence time measurements (Î¼s to ms range)
- Error rate scaling coefficients
- Cost-per-operation comparisons
- Maximum stable system sizes

### Deliverables
- Peer-reviewed publication in quantum computing journal
- Open-source benchmarking code
- Comparative performance database
- Technical recommendations for quantum algorithm developers

1. **Hardware development priorities**: Guide investment in quantum technologies
2. **Algorithm design**: Inform choice of quantum approach for specific problems
3. **Resource allocation**: Provide cost-benefit analysis for quantum computing users
4. **Theoretical validation**: Test predictions about quantum system scaling
