LOCAL SIMULATION (What we're doing now):
----------------------------------------
‚úÖ Runs on your classical computer (CPU/GPU)
‚úÖ Uses mathematical models to predict quantum behavior
‚úÖ Perfect for learning and algorithm development
‚úÖ Can simulate up to ~25-30 qubits efficiently
‚úÖ No noise, perfect operations
‚úÖ Instant results, no network delays

‚ùå NOT actually quantum - it's classical math
‚ùå Exponentially slow as qubit count increases
‚ùå Can't demonstrate quantum advantage for large problems
‚ùå No real quantum effects (decoherence, noise, etc.)

REAL QUANTUM COMPUTING (AWS, IBM, Google, etc.):
-----------------------------------------------
‚úÖ Uses actual quantum hardware (superconducting, trapped ions, etc.)
‚úÖ Real quantum superposition and entanglement
‚úÖ Can potentially solve problems classical computers can't
‚úÖ Demonstrates actual quantum effects

‚ùå Expensive and limited access
‚ùå Noisy and error-prone (current NISQ era)
‚ùå Network latency for cloud access
‚ùå Limited qubit counts (50-1000 qubits currently)
‚ùå Requires error correction for practical use
