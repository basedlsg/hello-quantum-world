# Experimental Investigation of Spatial Quantum Coherence in Mesoscopic Systems

## Abstract

This proposal outlines a systematic investigation into the relationship between spatial confinement and quantum coherence persistence in intermediate-scale quantum systems. Using AWS Braket quantum simulators and hardware, we aim to test whether spatial quantum effects exhibit different decoherence characteristics compared to non-spatial entanglement, potentially informing more robust quantum computing architectures.

## 1. Background and Motivation

### 1.1 Current Understanding
- Quantum entanglement in isolated systems is extremely fragile
- Biological systems maintain quantum coherence at room temperature
- Mesoscopic systems (10²-10⁶ particles) show hybrid quantum-classical behavior
- Spatial confinement creates discrete energy levels similar to atomic systems

### 1.2 Research Gap
Limited systematic study of how spatial quantum effects scale with system size and environmental coupling compared to non-spatial quantum correlations.

### 1.3 Hypothesis
**Primary Hypothesis**: Spatially-confined quantum systems exhibit enhanced decoherence resistance compared to non-spatial entangled systems of equivalent complexity.

**Secondary Hypothesis**: Optimal spatial confinement parameters exist that maximize quantum coherence lifetime while maintaining computational utility.
