## Individual Reviewer Comments

### Dr. Sarah Chen (Quantum Error Correction)

**Score: 7.5/10**

**Strengths:**
- Well-designed experimental protocol with appropriate controls
- Systematic approach to comparing different quantum architectures
- Realistic budget allocation and timeline
- Good understanding of current hardware limitations

**Concerns:**
- The fundamental difference between gate-based and spatial systems is already well-established in the literature
- Limited statistical power with only 100 shots per measurement on expensive QPUs
- Missing discussion of recent work by Henriet et al. (2020) on neutral atom quantum computing
- No power analysis to determine minimum effect size detectable with proposed sample sizes

**Recommendations:**
- Increase shot counts to at least 1000 per measurement for meaningful statistics
- Include comparison with recent IBM and Google error correction results
- Add systematic study of different error mitigation techniques
- Consider collaboration with hardware vendors for extended access

**Minor Issues:**
- Citation format inconsistent
- Some technical details about AHS protocols missing

### Prof. Michael Rodriguez (Neutral Atom Systems)

**Score: 8.0/10**

**Strengths:**
- Excellent choice of QuEra Aquila for spatial quantum studies
- Good understanding of Analog Hamiltonian Simulation protocols
- Realistic expectations about neutral atom coherence times
- Appropriate array geometries for systematic scaling study

**Concerns:**
- Oversimplified treatment of spatial quantum effects - these aren't just "quantum dots"
- Missing discussion of Rydberg blockade physics and its role in coherence
- No mention of recent advances in atom loading and site-resolved detection
- Spatial correlation measurements require more sophisticated protocols than described

**Technical Comments:**
- 16x16 atom arrays (256 atoms) are near current technical limits - consider 12x12 as backup
- Coherence times in ms range are optimistic - expect 10-100 Î¼s for current hardware
- Need to account for atom loss during experiments (~5-10% typical)

**Suggestions:**
- Include Rydberg blockade radius measurements
- Add comparison with trapped ion systems (IonQ) for spatial effects
- Consider quantum annealing protocols in addition to gate-based circuits

### Dr. Priya Patel (NISQ Algorithms)

**Score: 6.8/10**

**Strengths:**
- Addresses practical questions relevant to NISQ-era applications
- Good cost-benefit analysis framework
- Realistic assessment of current hardware capabilities
- Clear methodology for algorithm performance comparison

**Major Concerns:**
- **Limited algorithmic scope** - only testing optimization problems
- Missing comparison with quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) variants
- No discussion of variational quantum algorithms or their noise sensitivity
- Cost analysis doesn't account for classical preprocessing and postprocessing

**Missing Elements:**
- Benchmarking against state-of-the-art classical algorithms
- Analysis of quantum volume and algorithmic depth limits
- Discussion of error mitigation techniques (ZNE, PEC, etc.)
- Comparison with quantum annealing approaches (D-Wave)

**Recommendations:**
- Include at least 3 different algorithm families (optimization, simulation, machine learning)
- Add classical baseline comparisons for all test problems
- Extend budget to include more comprehensive algorithmic studies
- Consider hybrid classical-quantum approaches

### Prof. James Liu (Quantum Complexity Theory)

**Score: 6.5/10**

**Strengths:**
- Addresses fundamental questions about quantum computational models
- Good experimental design for complexity scaling studies
- Appropriate choice of problem sizes for complexity analysis

**Theoretical Concerns:**
- **Lacks theoretical framework** for expected scaling differences
- No discussion of quantum advantage thresholds or computational complexity implications
- Missing analysis of whether spatial vs gate-based represents fundamental computational difference
- No connection to established complexity classes (BQP, QMA, etc.)

**Scientific Rigor Issues:**
- Hypothesis too vague - needs specific, testable predictions
- No discussion of null hypothesis or statistical significance thresholds
- Missing power analysis for detecting meaningful effect sizes
- Unclear how results would change current understanding of quantum computation

**Recommendations:**
- Develop theoretical model predicting scaling differences
- Include complexity-theoretic analysis of problem classes
- Add discussion of quantum supremacy/advantage implications
- Consider collaboration with theoretical quantum complexity group

## Committee Discussion Points

### Strengths Identified by Panel:
1. **Practical Relevance:** Addresses real questions facing quantum computing practitioners
2. **Experimental Rigor:** Well-designed protocols with appropriate controls
3. **Budget Efficiency:** Realistic cost estimates and good resource allocation
4. **Timeliness:** Addresses current debates in NISQ-era quantum computing

### Major Concerns Raised:
1. **Limited Novelty:** Results may confirm what's already known rather than discover new phenomena
2. **Statistical Power:** Budget constraints limit ability to detect small but meaningful effects
3. **Theoretical Depth:** Lacks strong theoretical foundation for expected results
4. **Scope Limitations:** Too narrow focus on optimization problems

### Technical Issues:
1. **Hardware Access:** No contingency for QPU downtime or calibration issues

## Overall Assessment

This proposal addresses a legitimate research question with appropriate methodology, but falls short of the innovation and rigor expected for top-tier funding. The work would produce useful comparative data for the quantum computing community, but is unlikely to yield surprising or transformative results.

**Recommendation:** Fund as a solid incremental contribution to quantum computing benchmarking literature, with expectation of publication in second-tier quantum information journals.

**Expected Impact:** Moderate - will inform hardware development priorities and algorithm design choices, but unlikely to change fundamental understanding of quantum computation.

**Risk Level:** Low - well-established techniques with predictable outcomes.

## Dissenting Opinion (Dr. Patel)

I respectfully disagree with the funding recommendation. While technically sound, this proposal lacks the innovation and potential impact expected from NSF funding. The $15,000 would be better allocated to more ambitious projects exploring novel quantum algorithms or fundamental quantum information theory.

The "gap in literature" claimed by the authors is not compelling - the differences between gate-based and spatial quantum systems are well-understood theoretically. This feels more like an engineering comparison than fundamental research.

**Alternative Recommendation:** Encourage authors to resubmit with more ambitious scope or novel theoretical insights.
