## Detailed Reviews

### Dr. Sarah Chen (Quantum Information Theory)
**Rating: 6/10**

**Strengths:**
- Addresses genuine gap in understanding decoherence scaling
- Well-structured experimental phases with clear progression
- Appropriate use of AWS Braket infrastructure
- Realistic timeline and budget estimates

**Major Concerns:**
1. **Theoretical Foundation**: The distinction between "spatial" and "non-spatial" quantum effects lacks rigorous mathematical definition. What exactly constitutes spatial confinement in a qubit system?

2. **Experimental Design Flaw**: Current quantum hardware cannot truly implement spatial confinement as described. The proposal conflates circuit-based quantum computing with condensed matter physics.

3. **Measurement Challenges**: How will the team distinguish between enhanced coherence due to spatial effects versus simply better isolation or different error models?

**Recommendations:**
- Provide mathematical framework defining spatial vs. non-spatial quantum systems
- Clarify how spatial confinement will be implemented using available quantum gates
- Include control experiments to isolate claimed effects

### Prof. Michael Rodriguez (Mesoscopic Physics)
**Rating: 5/10**

**Strengths:**
- Recognizes importance of mesoscopic regime
- Acknowledges scale limitations honestly
- Reasonable approach to simulation studies

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Scale Mismatch**: True mesoscopic effects occur at 10⁶+ particle scales. Current quantum computers operate at ~10² qubit scales. The physics may be fundamentally different.

2. **Missing Literature**: No reference to extensive existing work on mesoscopic quantum transport, Anderson localization, or quantum dots in semiconductor systems.

3. **Oversimplified Model**: Treating quantum dots as simple "boxes" ignores complex many-body interactions, Coulomb blockade, and spin effects that dominate real systems.

**Recommendations:**
- Reduce claims about mesoscopic physics
- Focus on what can actually be measured with current hardware
- Include proper literature review of mesoscopic quantum physics

### Dr. Priya Patel (Quantum Computing Hardware)
**Rating: 7/10**

**Strengths:**
- Realistic assessment of AWS Braket capabilities
- Appropriate hardware selection for experiments
- Good understanding of current technological limitations
- Reasonable budget for quantum hardware access

**Technical Concerns:**
1. **Implementation Gap**: Unclear how spatial confinement translates to actual quantum circuits. Current quantum computers use discrete qubits, not continuous spatial systems.

2. **Noise Model Validity**: The proposal assumes noise models can accurately represent environmental coupling differences, but this is unproven.

3. **Hardware Heterogeneity**: Different quantum processors (IonQ, Rigetti, IBM) have vastly different architectures. Cross-platform validation may be comparing apples to oranges.

**Recommendations:**
- Provide explicit quantum circuit implementations for key experiments
- Validate noise models against known experimental data
- Focus on single hardware platform initially

### Prof. James Wilson (Statistical Physics)
**Rating: 4/10**

**Strengths:**
- Acknowledges statistical significance requirements
- Plans appropriate controls and baselines
- Recognizes importance of error mitigation

**Fundamental Problems:**
1. **Statistical Design**: No power analysis provided. How many measurements needed for statistical significance? What effect size is expected?

2. **Confounding Variables**: Multiple variables change simultaneously (system size, spatial configuration, hardware platform). Difficult to isolate causal relationships.

3. **Reproducibility**: No discussion of how results will be validated by independent groups. Single-lab studies in quantum computing have poor reproducibility track record.

**Recommendations:**
- Include formal statistical analysis plan
- Design factorial experiments to isolate individual effects
- Plan for independent replication studies

## Committee Synthesis

### Unanimous Concerns
1. **Conceptual Clarity**: The core hypothesis lacks mathematical rigor
2. **Implementation Gap**: Unclear how ideas translate to actual quantum circuits
3. **Scale Limitations**: Current hardware cannot access relevant physical regimes
4. **Literature Integration**: Missing key prior work in related fields

### Split Opinions
- **Novelty**: Some reviewers see genuine innovation, others see confusion of concepts
- **Feasibility**: Hardware experts more optimistic than theorists
- **Impact**: Disagreement on whether results would be scientifically significant

### Consensus Recommendation: **CONDITIONAL APPROVAL**

**Required Revisions:**
1. **Narrow Scope**: Focus on achievable measurements with current hardware
2. **Mathematical Framework**: Provide rigorous definitions of spatial vs. non-spatial effects
3. **Circuit Implementation**: Show explicit quantum circuits for key experiments
4. **Literature Review**: Include comprehensive background on related work
5. **Statistical Plan**: Formal experimental design with power analysis

**Reduced Budget**: $10,000-15,000 (focus on simulation studies initially)

**Timeline**: 6 months for proof-of-concept, then reassess

## Final Committee Vote

**Approve with Major Revisions**: 3 votes  
**Reject and Resubmit**: 1 vote  
**Unconditional Approval**: 0 votes  
**Reject**: 0 votes

**Overall Assessment**: Interesting ideas that require significant development before experimental implementation. The research question has merit, but the experimental approach needs substantial refinement to be scientifically rigorous and technically feasible.

**Next Steps**: 
1. Resubmit revised proposal addressing all technical concerns
2. Consider collaboration with experimentalists in mesoscopic physics
3. Start with smaller-scale theoretical/simulation study before hardware experiments
