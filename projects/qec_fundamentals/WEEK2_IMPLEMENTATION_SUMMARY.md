# Week 2 Implementation: 5-Qubit Shor Code with Scientific Rigor

## Executive Summary

Building on the validated methodology from spatial locality investigations, Week 2 implements the 5-qubit Shor code with rigorous experimental controls, statistical validation, and cross-platform verification.

## Scientific Methodology Framework

### Core Principle: Control for Confounding Variables
**Lesson from spatial locality work**: "The total number of noisy two-qubit operations is the primary driver of circuit fidelity" - we apply this insight to QEC comparison.

### Experimental Design Standards

#### 1. **Controlled Variables**
- **Gate Count Parity**: 3-qubit vs 5-qubit codes normalized by operation count
- **Noise Load Equality**: Same total T1/T2 exposure across comparisons  
- **Circuit Depth Control**: Balanced logical depth between codes
- **Measurement Standardization**: Identical fidelity metrics (Hilbert-Schmidt overlap)

#### 2. **Statistical Validation**
- **Multiple Seeds**: 10 unique random instances per test
- **Confidence Intervals**: 95% CI for all reported metrics
- **Significance Testing**: p-values for QEC advantage claims
- **Effect Size**: Cohen's d for practical significance

#### 3. **Realistic Noise Model**
```python
# Validated T1/T2 parameters from hardware characterization
T1, T2, GATE_TIME = 40e-6, 60e-6, 200e-9
P_AMPLITUDE = 1 - np.exp(-GATE_TIME / T1)  # 0.004988
P_DEPHASING = 1 - np.exp(-GATE_TIME / T2)  # 0.003328
```

#### 4. **Cross-Platform Validation**
- **Local Simulation**: Baseline results with perfect reproducibility
- **AWS DM1 Validation**: Cloud verification within $0.50 budget
- **Consistency Check**: |AWS - Local| < 0.001 tolerance

## Research Questions (Testable Hypotheses)

### **H1**: 5-Qubit Advantage Hypothesis
*"The 5-qubit Shor code provides statistically significant QEC advantage over 3-qubit codes under realistic T1/T2 noise."*

**Test Design**:
- **Null Hypothesis**: No difference in logical fidelity between codes
- **Statistical Test**: Two-sample t-test, α = 0.05
- **Power Analysis**: β = 0.8, minimum detectable effect = 0.02 fidelity
- **Control**: Equal noise exposure per logical operation

### **H2**: Threshold Identification
*"There exists a critical noise scale where 5-qubit codes transition from advantage to disadvantage."*

**Test Design**:
- **Noise Sweep**: 0.1x to 10x baseline noise in 0.5x increments
- **Threshold Definition**: Crossover point where QEC advantage = 0
- **Confidence Bounds**: Bootstrap CI for threshold estimate
- **Validation**: Independent threshold measurement on AWS

### **H3**: Syndrome Accuracy Scaling
*"5-qubit syndrome detection maintains >95% accuracy under realistic noise."*

**Test Design**:
- **Error Injection**: All 31 possible single/double Pauli errors
- **Statistical Power**: n=1000 trials per error pattern
- **Accuracy Metric**: Syndrome → Error mapping success rate
- **Noise Robustness**: Performance degradation under T1/T2 noise
