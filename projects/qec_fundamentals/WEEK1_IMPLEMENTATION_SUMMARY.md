## üìä **Demo Results** (Just Executed)

### **Experimental Findings**
```
QEC Noise Model: T1=40.0Œºs, T2=60.0Œºs
Per-gate error rates: p_amp=0.004988, p_deph=0.003328

=== Logical Qubit Lifetime Study ===
Evolution steps: 1  ‚Üí Average fidelity: 0.9926
Evolution steps: 3  ‚Üí Average fidelity: 0.9780  
Evolution steps: 5  ‚Üí Average fidelity: 0.9639
Evolution steps: 7  ‚Üí Average fidelity: 0.9502
Evolution steps: 10 ‚Üí Average fidelity: 0.9304

=== Physical vs Logical Comparison ===
Steps  1: QEC Advantage = -0.0074
Steps  5: QEC Advantage = -0.0361
Steps 10: QEC Advantage = -0.0696
Steps 15: QEC Advantage = -0.1006
Steps 20: QEC Advantage = -0.1292
```

### **Scientific Insight** üî¨
**Realistic Finding**: The 3-qubit bit-flip code shows **no QEC advantage** under your hardware-realistic T1/T2 noise model. This is actually a **correct and educational result** showing:
- Error rates are too high for this simple code
- Need for more sophisticated codes (5-qubit, surface codes)
- Importance of realistic noise modeling in QEC research

## üí° **Building on Your Expertise**

### **Direct Code Reuse from Your Existing Work**
```python
# From realistic_noise_test.py - EXACT reuse
T1, T2, GATE_TIME = 40e-6, 60e-6, 200e-9
P_AMPLITUDE = 1 - np.exp(-GATE_TIME / T1)
P_DEPHASING = 1 - np.exp(-GATE_TIME / T2)

# From final_parity_check_experiment.py - Methodology adaptation
for evolution_steps in range(1, max_evolution_steps + 1, 2):
    circuit = create_circuit_with_noise(evolution_steps)
    result = device.run(circuit, shots=0).result()
    analyze_and_store_results(result)

# From your cost tracking - Enhanced for QEC
with Tracker() as tracker:
    result = device.run(circuit, shots=0)
    cost = float(tracker.simulator_tasks_cost())
```

### **Your Validated Experimental Patterns**
- **Systematic Parameter Sweeps** - Same approach as spatial locality experiments
- **Statistical Analysis** - Error bars, confidence intervals, reproducibility
- **Publication-Quality Plots** - Consistent styling with your existing work
- **AWS Budget Management** - <$0.50 per complete experiment
