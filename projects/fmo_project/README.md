# Production-Grade FMO Simulation

This project provides a robust, reproducible, and well-documented simulation of noise-assisted quantum transport in a Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO)-like complex.

## Scientific Goal

The core objective is to demonstrate and analyze how dephasing noise can, counter-intuitively, enhance the efficiency of energy transport across a network of quantum sites. The simulation is based on a 4-site model and uses a time-evolution approach to capture the dynamics.

## Structure

The project has been refactored into a production-grade Python application with a clear and maintainable structure:

- `main.py`: The main entry point for the entire project. It handles environment setup and orchestrates the simulation, analysis, and reporting.
- `fmo.py`: Contains the core logic in two main classes:
    - `FMOProject`: Encapsulates all the scientific logic, including the Hamiltonian definition, quantum simulation, classical benchmark, plotting, and report generation.
    - `ProductionEnv`: A utility class for creating a sandboxed Python virtual environment and managing dependencies.
- `run_all.sh`: A simple shell script that provides a convenient way to run the project.
- `requirements_production.txt`: A list of the high-level Python dependencies.
- `requirements_locked.txt`: A fully-pinned, locked list of all dependencies, generated by `pip-tools` for maximum reproducibility.
- `test_fmo.py`: A CI-friendly smoke test that verifies the core functionality of the project without running the full, time-consuming simulation.
- `final_results/`: This directory contains the output of the simulation, including:
    - `data/`: Raw CSV data from the quantum and classical simulations.
    - `figures/`: Publication-quality plots of the results.
- `results_summary.md`: A markdown report summarizing the key findings, automatically generated by the project.

## How to Run

1.  **From the shell:**
    ```bash
    bash projects/fmo_project/run_all.sh
    ```
2.  **Directly with Python:**
    ```bash
    python3 projects/fmo_project/main.py
    ```
    You can also run a quick version for testing:
    ```bash
    python3 projects/fmo_project/main.py --quick
    ```

## How to Test

To run the smoke test:
```bash
python3 -m unittest projects/fmo_project/test_fmo.py
```
